# üéØ Level Design Guide for Orbital Strike

## Core Design Philosophy

**"Easy to learn, satisfying to master"** - Each level should teach one new concept while building on previous skills.

## üéÆ Satisfaction Formula

### The Perfect Level Has:
1. **2-4 solution paths** (player choice = engagement)
2. **1-3 gravity assists required** (skill demonstration)  
3. **No direct shots** (forces creative thinking)
4. **Clear visual logic** (player can "see" the solution)
5. **Progressive revelation** (solution becomes obvious after experimentation)

## üìä Difficulty Progression

### Beginner (Levels 1-3)
- **Goal**: Teach gravity basics
- **Bodies**: 1-2 space bodies
- **Targets**: 2-4 targets
- **Concepts**: Basic gravity assists, trajectory planning
- **Satisfaction**: "I understand physics!"

### Intermediate (Levels 4-8) 
- **Goal**: Combine multiple concepts
- **Bodies**: 2-4 space bodies
- **Targets**: 4-6 targets  
- **Concepts**: Multi-body interactions, timing, orbital mechanics
- **Satisfaction**: "I'm getting good at this!"

### Advanced (Levels 9+)
- **Goal**: Master complex systems
- **Bodies**: 4-6 space bodies
- **Targets**: 6+ targets
- **Concepts**: Precision timing, complex trajectories, efficiency
- **Satisfaction**: "I'm a physics wizard!"

## üß† Psychological Design Patterns

### 1. The "Aha!" Moment Pattern
```json
{
  "setup": "Target seems impossible to reach",
  "misdirection": "Player tries obvious but wrong approaches", 
  "revelation": "Gravity well can be used as slingshot",
  "satisfaction": "Of course! Why didn't I see that before?"
}
```

### 2. The Building Complexity Pattern
- Level N: Introduce concept in isolation
- Level N+1: Combine with previous concept  
- Level N+2: Add variation/twist
- Level N+3: Master through challenge

### 3. The Multiple Paths Pattern
```json
{
  "easy_path": "3 gravity assists, forgiving timing",
  "medium_path": "2 gravity assists, precise aim required",
  "expert_path": "1 gravity assist, perfect execution",
  "bonus": "All paths lead to same satisfaction"
}
```

## üéØ Target Placement Strategy

### Effective Positions:
- **Behind large bodies** (forces slingshot thinking)
- **In gravity shadows** (requires indirect approach)
- **Corner positions** (multiple body interactions needed)
- **Moving targets** (adds timing challenge)

### Avoid These:
- Direct line of sight from cannon
- Positions reachable with simple arc shots
- Impossible positions (frustration)
- Random placement without strategic purpose

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Testing Metrics

### Use Level Validator to Check:

```javascript
// Good level metrics:
{
  solutionCount: 6-12,        // 2-4 solutions per target
  averageGravityAssists: 1.5-2.5,
  difficultyScore: 30-60,     // Sweet spot
  directShotsBlocked: 0,      // No easy shots
  frustrationRisk: 'low'
}
```

### Red Flags:
- ‚ùå `solutionCount < 3` (too restrictive)
- ‚ùå `solutionCount > 20` (too easy)  
- ‚ùå `averageGravityAssists < 0.5` (not physics-based)
- ‚ùå `averageGravityAssists > 4` (too complex)
- ‚ùå `difficultyScore > 80` (frustration zone)

## üé® Visual Design Principles

### 1. Clear Affordances
- Gravity fields visible and predictable
- Space body sizes indicate gravitational strength
- Trajectory preview helps planning

### 2. Readable Layouts
- Space bodies form recognizable patterns
- Clear path between major elements
- Avoid visual clutter

### 3. Intuitive Flow
- Eye naturally follows intended solution path
- Gravity wells "point" toward target areas
- Composition guides player attention

## üìù Level Creation Checklist

### Before Finalizing a Level:

- [ ] **Run level validator** - Check all metrics
- [ ] **Test multiple solutions** - Ensure 2-4 paths exist
- [ ] **Playtest with others** - Watch for frustration points
- [ ] **Check difficulty curve** - Fits progression
- [ ] **Verify teaching goal** - One new concept per level
- [ ] **Test on mobile** - Works in portrait mode
- [ ] **Time to complete** - 30 seconds to 3 minutes optimal

### Quality Gates:
1. **Can I solve it in under 5 attempts?** (not too hard)
2. **Does it require creativity?** (not too easy)  
3. **Will I remember the solution?** (satisfying pattern)
4. **Does it teach something new?** (progression value)

## üåü Advanced Techniques

### Orbiting Targets
```json
{
  "movementType": "orbit",
  "orbitCenter": {"x": "centerX", "y": "centerY"},
  "orbitRadius": 80,
  "orbitalSpeed": 0.5
}
```
**Use for**: Timing challenges, realistic physics demonstration

### Gravity Chains
- Place bodies in sequence to create "gravity highway"
- Each body redirects bullet toward next
- Final body slingshots toward target

### Binary Systems
- Two large bodies create complex gravity field
- Multiple stable and unstable trajectories
- Advanced players can find elegant solutions

## üîß Testing Your Levels

### Manual Testing Process:
1. **Load level in validator**
2. **Review metrics report**
3. **Playtest personally** (5+ attempts)
4. **Get feedback from others**
5. **Iterate based on data**

### Common Issues and Fixes:

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too Easy | `difficultyScore < 20` | Block direct shots, add bodies |
| Too Hard | `solutionCount < 2` | Add alternative paths |  
| Frustrating | High attempt count | Provide visual hints |
| Boring | Single solution | Create multiple approaches |

## üéØ Example Analysis

**Level 3 - Triangle Formation**
```
‚úÖ Good: 3 space bodies create multiple gravity interactions
‚úÖ Good: 5 targets require different approaches  
‚úÖ Good: No direct line of sight to any target
‚ö†Ô∏è  Watch: May be too complex for level 3
üí° Suggestion: Consider moving to level 4-5
```

**Remember**: Great levels feel inevitable in hindsight but require genuine creativity to solve. The best compliment is: *"Of course! Why didn't I see that sooner?"*
